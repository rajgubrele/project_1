There are a total of 16 models (Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant, Gauss-Jordan, Gauss-Siedel, Power factor, QR factorization, Linear curve fitting & Quadratic curve fitting, Quadratic Splines, Cubic Splines, Trapezoidal, Simpson's, Euler's method, and Runge Kutta second order)

Briefly about what the function does, what is the function used to calculate, a description of the input variables and the values returned by the function. It takes all the input values, maximum error limit, roundoff value, etc These models are completely dynamic

Whenever the tag corresponding to optional parameters is true, the code will print the intermediate iterations in a particular format.
